### VSCode/UE4 Intellisense Fix

VSCode Extension now supports Unreal Engine v4.25 and v4.26.

## 2021-23-1
#### Big Update 0.9.5 is out now
- Tag Parser improvements
- Universal general UE4 c_cpp_properties.json
- Backup Intellisense for Main workspace
- Settings improvements (breaking change)

1. Remember to reset your project first
2. When you've run the fix and it working make sure to reset the Tag Parser cache to take advantage of the smaller cache size
3. From the Command Palette type reset and choose 'C/C++: Reset Intellisense Database'
4. It'll take ~15 minutes for the Tag Parser to finish running

#### Note: Gist Readme isn't updated yet for 0.9.5
